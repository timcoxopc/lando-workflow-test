# Imports image files into the files_managed table.
#
# Imports up to 3 files per row. Each file name is a separate column. If your
# migration has many files it is a good idea to copy them to the destination
# by some fast method, i.e. rsync. The files can be put directly into the final
# directory, i.e. public://. This migration does not need to move or copy the
# file but it must be run in order to initialize the file entity for each file.
#
# When the source and destination directory are the same be aware that a
# rollback of this migration will delete the files from the source directory.
# Please plan your development and production work flows with that in mind.
#
# Destination site configuration:
#   - Install the File Module.
